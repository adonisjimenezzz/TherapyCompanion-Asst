# Therapy Companion Agent: Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Therapy Companion Agent is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to provide cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) support, emotional regulation techniques, and mental wellness guidance. This system functions as a supplementary tool to traditional therapy, offering continuous support between professional sessions through personalized interventions and progress tracking.

## System Architecture

The Therapy Companion Agent follows a modular architecture with specialized components handling different aspects of the therapeutic process:

```
TherapyCompanionAgent
├── EmotionTracker
├── InterventionEngine
├── ResourceManager
├── ProgressTracker
├── SafetyModule
└── NLPProcessor
```

## Functional Workflows

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Session Initialization**
   - Assess current emotional state
   - Create session context based on user history and profile
   - Generate personalized greeting and session plan
   - Suggest focus areas and activities

2. **Session Interaction**
   - Process user input through NLP analysis
   - Evaluate safety concerns
   - Update emotional tracking
   - Select appropriate therapeutic interventions
   - Record interactions in session history

3. **Session Conclusion**
   - Generate session summary with key themes and insights
   - Update progress metrics
   - Suggest home practice activities
   - Recommend timing and focus for next session

### Safety Protocol

The agent implements a tiered safety protocol based on detected risk levels:

1. **Emergency Response**
   - Triggered by suicide ideation indicators
   - Provides immediate crisis resources
   - Clearly communicates seriousness of concern
   - Encourages immediate professional intervention

2. **Warning Response**
   - Triggered by self-harm indicators or high distress
   - Provides supportive resources
   - Offers continuation of conversation with safety focus
   - Suggests professional support options

3. **Supportive Response**
   - Triggered by moderate emotional distress
   - Acknowledges difficulty without escalation
   - Offers grounding techniques
   - Maintains therapeutic conversation

### Intervention Selection

The agent employs a multi-factor algorithm to select therapeutic interventions:

1. Identify primary emotional need from user input and state
2. Match need to appropriate intervention category
3. Filter interventions based on user history and preferences
4. Select specific intervention technique with controlled randomization
5. Personalize intervention content with user context
6. Deliver intervention with appropriate framing and follow-up

## Implementation Guidelines

### User Profile Structure

```javascript
userProfile = {
  therapeuticGoals: ['anxiety-management', 'stress-reduction'],
  currentStressors: ['work', 'relationships'],
  sessionFrequency: 7, // preferred days between sessions
  preferredDuration: '10 min', // preferred activity duration
  preferredActivityType: 'exercise', // preferred activity type
  interventionEffectiveness: {
    'breathing-exercise': 0.8,
    'cognitive-reframing': 0.6
    // Additional intervention effectiveness ratings
  }
}
```

### Emotional State Structure

```javascript
emotionalState = {
  overall: 5, // 1-10 scale
  anxiety: 5, // 1-10 scale
  depression: 5, // 1-10 scale
  anger: 5, // 1-10 scale
  joy: 5, // 1-10 scale
  timestamp: Date
}
```

### Session History Structure

```javascript
sessionHistory = [
  {
    timestamp: Date,
    userInput: String,
    agentResponse: Object,
    emotionalState: Object,
    focusArea: String
  }
  // Additional session interactions
]
```

## Integration Points
